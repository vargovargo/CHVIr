## Welcome to CCHVIz 

#### CCHVIz is the interactive data visualization platform for the Climate and Health Vulnerability Indicators (CHVIs). It is produced by the CA Department of Public Health's [Office of Health Equity](http://bit.ly/CDPHOHE). 


The [CalBRACE](bit.ly/calbrace) Project produced climate change and health vulnerability indicators for download on our 'Download Your Data' tab or from the [program's website](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/CC-Health-Vulnerability-Indicators.aspx). Each indicator includes the data in an Excel file as well as a narrative in PDF format. Each narrative describes the indicator’s significance to climate change and health, the evidence that links the indicator to health outcomes, data sources, bibliographic references, methodology, and limitations that impact the interpretation of the indicator. 

Visit [CalBRACE's website](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/CC-Health-Vulnerability-Indicators.aspx) to download details of each indicator’s significance and methods involved in its development. 


## Latest Updates
