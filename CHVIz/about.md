## Welcome to CCHVIz 

#### CCHVIz is the interactive data visualization platform for the Climate Change & Health Vulnerability Indicators for California (CCHVIs). It is produced by the CA Department of Public Health's [Office of Health Equity](http://bit.ly/CDPHOHE).

The CalBRACE Project produced Climate Change and Health 
Vulnerability Indicators to help stakeholders better understand the people and places that are more susceptible to adverse health impacts associated with climate change. They are a suite of 21 indicators (right) of climate exposure, population sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to the impacts of climate change. These indicators are being used by local and state programs to plan to meet the needs of the communities most at risk of harm from climate change.  

Indicator data are available for download on the 'Download Your Data' tab or from the [CalBRACE website](bit.ly/calbrace). You can also download narratives describing each indicatorâ€™s significance to climate change and health, the evidence that links the indicator to health outcomes, data sources, bibliographic references, methodology, and limitations that impact the interpretation of the indicator.
