## Vulnerability 

#### See how California counties rank according to combined vulnerability made up of exposure and sensitivity 

The plot illustrates the intersection of hazard (due to increased climate change impacts) and sensitivity (due to characteristics of the population that make them more susceptible to the hazards of climate change). Counties are assigned to the bottom (least), middle, or top (most) third for both exposure and sensitivity.  The most vulnerable counties appear in top and right-most portions of the figure.  Points are sized according to the population living in that county. Hover over points for the indicator values, county name, and population.
