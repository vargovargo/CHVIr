## Vulnerability 

#### Visualize how the California Counties relate according to an exposure variable and a population sensitivity variable. 

The plot helps illustrate the intersection of hazard - due to increased climate change impacts - and sensitivity - due to characteristics of the population that make them more susceptible to the hazards of climate change. The most vulnerable counties appear in top and right-most portions of the figure. Red counties are in the top third of all California counties for both exposure and sensitivity variables, and points are sized according to the population living in that county. Hover over points for the indicator values, county name, and population.
