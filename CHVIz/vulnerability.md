## Vulnerability 

#### Visualize California Counties based on levels of both an exposure variable and a population sensitivity variable. 

The plot illustrates the intersection of hazard (from an aspect of climate change) and sensitivity (from circumstances of the population or place that tend to increase susceptibility to the hazards of climate change). Counties are assigned to the bottom (least), middle, or top (most) third for both exposure and sensitivity.  The most vulnerable counties appear in top and right-most portions of the figure.  Points are sized according to the population living in that county. Hover over points for the county name, population, and indicator values.

Some examples of important combinations to consider are
- Heat + elderly / outdoor workers / health insurance / air conditioning / tree canopy / impervious surfaces
- Ozone + children 
- PM2.5 + children 
- Wildfire + elderly / disability
